# non-us-election
A Struts2 web application that showed a poll for any non-U.S. countries to submit their preference for the outcome of the U.S. general election. 

This was created  during the Obamba vs McCain presidential campaigns in 2008.

I used a Goolge Adwords voucher to a small amount of drive traffic to the app.

FYI, the outcome was favourable to the democratic party (Obama) in all countries that voted (often > 75% of votes), which wouldn't be a surprise if you lived outside the U.S. at the time.
